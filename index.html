		<p><em>Dreamer and ramblin man.</em>.</p>
		<p>Hi this is Paul.  It's time to attempt to answer the question 'What about Paul?'</p>
		<p>Some people group activities as left or right brained and I feel like I am both analytical and artistic.
			I think my analytical side tends be a bit of a perfectionist and stifle my artistic side.  Even though
			I am over 50, I try to stay curios and learn new things.  I definitely like solving problems like a programming
			task, fixing a vehicle or getting better at cooking a recipe.</p>
